# Discussion rules

1. Nobody here has time for people who are mean. You will get blocked from the repo if you troll or are otherwise a jerk for no good reason. Be supportive of other peoples ideas and take your snark elsewhere.

## Administrators

Some people are Owners meaning they can close issues etc. But you don't have to be an Owner to participate in the discussions.
